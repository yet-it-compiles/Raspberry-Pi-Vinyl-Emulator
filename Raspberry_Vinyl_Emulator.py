@Version: 1.0.0 - [Ready for Testing #1]

@Description:
This module contains the logic for a Spotify-NFC-Sonos Controller.

This controller is designed to read NFC tags, extract Spotify URIs from them, 
and control a Sonos sound system accordingly. 

@Features:
- Initialization and configuration of an NFC reader
- Initialization of a Sonos sound system and Spotify 
- Detecting NFC tags and reading their NDEF [NFC Data Exchange Format] records
- Extracting Spotify URIs from the NDEF [NFC Data Exchange Format] records
- Checking Sonos API connectivity
- Clearing the current Sonos queue
- Sending commands to Sonos system to play music linked by the Spotify URIs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Retrieving album cover URLs via Spotify API [!not yet fully implemented!]

@Notes:
- Requires Spotify client id, client secret, and redirect URI to be assigned
- The Sonos IP address and room name are also necessary to be assigned
- It's assumed that the NFC reader is connected to one of the following ports:
    o tty:AMA0 | tty:S0 | tty:USB0
- Exception handling mechanisms are in place for errors related to the Sonos API
 and the NFC reader
